The Random Password Generator is a web-based tool that generates secure and random passwords for users. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, users can specify the length and complexity of the password they require. The application then generates a password consisting of a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. JavaScript handles the logic for generating random passwords based on user input and updating the user interface with the generated password. This tool enhances security by providing users with strong and unique passwords for various online accounts and applications.
